<h1>Can—and should—writers learn to code?</h1>

<body><p>Not long ago, I applied for a remote position as an acquisitions editor (AE) with a leading technology publisher. I've worked in house for several major publishers, including Elsevier (the world's largest medical publisher) and McGraw-Hill. Becoming an AE again after 13 years of self-employment wasn't really my plan. I'm better at writing than talking to people. But this job description seemed to have been written for me, and I was über-excited about the idea of commissioning artificial intelligence content.</p>

<p>I write occasionally about technology for Slate and have followed developments in AI for several years. This job would give me the opportunity to meet AI pioneers and help optimize their content for hungry audiences in machine learning, data science, data engineering, and other fields. I'd be able to think outside the book, so to speak, and present vanguard AI developments in really innovative ways.</p>

<p>During my phone screen with the recruiter, everything clicked—probably because my enthusiasm was real and my publishing background a great fit. No need for any song and dance. She was eager to introduce me to her client. A day or two later, she sent me this email:</p>

<p class="tab">Unfortunately we’re not able to move forward on this. I do have some context if you would like to discuss by phone, just let me know when works best. Either way, I’ll be sure to let you know if something similar crosses my desk.</p>

<p>Ooph! Gut punch. When I spoke to the recruiter the next day, she was tactful: "They said your qualifications were impressive, but you've been out of the game too long." It's true that my last job as an AE was more than a decade ago. My Rolodex of tech industry contacts is as nonexistent as...well, Rolodex. And maybe that was really the issue. If so, fair enough.

But I've never been out of the publishing game, if that's what they meant. During my 13 years of self-employment, I've been immersed in content development, ghostwriting, editing, marketing, storyboarding, beta testing, competitive analysis, and more. 

Could "out of the game" be code for "too old to work in technology"? I serve as my own IT department and work on an iMac 10-11 hours a day. I'm dogged about untangling snafus and learning new tools (e.g., Illustrator). When I'm not working, I'm usually on my iPhone or iPad. 

<p>But does getting a lot of screen time make me tech savvy? As a writer, I don't think it's enough. If I want to develop rich content and document the work of the brightest minds in aeronautical engineering or medical device manufacturing or cybersecurity, I need to know how to code.
