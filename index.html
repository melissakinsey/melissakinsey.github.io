      <h2>Why I'm learning to code</h2>
         <p>Not long ago, I applied for a remote editorial position with a leading technology publisher. I didn't get the job, but the experience got me thinking about my tech skills. I work on a Mac 10 or 11 hours a day. Because I'm self-employed, I have no IT department to fall back on. But does getting a lot of screen time and knowing how to solve routine computer problems make me tech savvy? As a medical and technical writer, I don't think it's enough. To develop rich content and document vanguard work in aeronautical engineering or medical device manufacturing or cybersecurity, I need to know how to code.</p>

<p>I'm still disappointed about that job, but grateful that the closed door inspired me to acquire new skills that will, I hope, be marketable long into the future.</p>

      <p>I've been a medical writer and editor for more than 20 years. My goal in learning to code is not necessarily to work as a developer or programmer, but merely to gain street cred as a tech writer. So far, I've learned a little about coding and a lot about people. I'm humbled by all the kind, thoughtful advice I've received from those who are miles ahead of me on this journey (or in another mountain range altogether). Thank you to those who have reached out to offer help and encouragement!</p>
