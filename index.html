      <p>I've been a medical writer and editor for more than 20 years. My goal in learning to code is not necessarily to work as a developer or programmer, but merely to gain street cred as a tech writer. So far, I've learned a little about coding and a lot about people. I'm humbled by all the kind, thoughtful advice I've received from those who are miles ahead of me on this journey (or in another mountain range altogether). Thank you to those who have reached out to offer help and encouragement!</p>

      <h2>Why I'm learning to code</h2>
         <p>Not long ago, I applied for a remote editorial position with a leading technology publisher. I didn't get the job, but the experience got me thinking about my tech skills. I work on a Mac 10 or 11 hours a day. Because I'm self-employed, I have no IT department to fall back on. But does getting a lot of screen time and knowing how to solve routine computer problems make me tech savvy? As a medical and technical writer, I don't think it's enough. To develop rich content and document vanguard work in aeronautical engineering or medical device manufacturing or cybersecurity, I need to know how to code.</p>

<p>I'm still disappointed about that job, but grateful that the closed door inspired me to acquire new skills that will, I hope, be marketable long into the future.</p>

<h2>Day 2</h2>
<h3>Friday, June 15</h3>
<p>Not as much time to work today as yesterday, but I'm now halfway through the CSS segment. The website I built with Divi in WordPress (HowtoWriteanOnlineObit.com) offers optional CSS, and I've used it a time or two to customize my page. But I had no idea what I was doing. I just copied and pasted code from various tutorials and articles. With trial and error, I made it work. But it feels great to be able to read some code, even at a rudimentary level for the time being.</p>
<p>I've been a podcast junkie for 6 or 7 years, so naturally I found the FCC podcast right away. I listen while I clean, exercise, cook, etc. So I've already heard several episodes. I find them really inspiring and encouraging. One episode pointed out that some people in tech don't like code camps because they open the door to anyone, thereby increasing industry competition. Competition eventually lowers compensation.</p> 
<p>I'm sympathetic to that kind of gatekeeping. As a self-employed writer, I compete with new writers across the country — around the world, really. The difference between self-taught coders and self-proclaimed writers, though, is that anyone can call himself a writer on Day 1. He doesn't even have to attend freeWritingCamp, much less earn an M.A. 
So developers with computer science (C.S.) degrees should take some comfort in knowing that code camp graduates have at least put in a few hundred hours of work to learn the basics. They can't just hang out a shingle. The rigor of any code camp, whether it's formal classroom-style training or an online platform, will deter anyone who's looking for an easy ride. Your mom might still do your laundry, but she can't do your coding for you.</p>
<p>Besides, Quincy Larson, the founder of freeCodeCamp, would probably say that opening the door to anyone is the whole point. Everyone should learn to code, but not everyone can be a C.S. major or pay thousands of dollars to attend a coding school. Sites like freeCodeCamp make it possible for anyone to learn, no matter their circumstances—strapped for cash, rural, disabled, or otherwise unable to tap into formal educational channels.</p>
<p>I'll probably never call myself a coder or developer or programmer. At best, I might acquire some basic coding skills. But I'm hoping that those skills will help me better understand the science and technology content I write about.</p>
